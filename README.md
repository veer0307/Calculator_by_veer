This code creates a basic calculator using four functions: add(a, b) for addition, sub(a, b) for subtraction, mul(a, b) for multiplication, and div(a, b) for division. The user is prompted to choose an operation by entering one of the symbols: +, -, *, or /. After selecting the operation, the user inputs two numbers.
The program then uses conditional statements (if, elif, else) to determine which function to call based on the user's choice, and it performs the corresponding operation on the two numbers provided. If the user inputs anything other than the specified symbols, the program quits.
